# Welcome to Christian’s Keyboard Catalog

If you love programable, mechanical keyboards (and alliteration), you’ll love this repo. To start, I’m storing _some_ of my keyboard configurations here.

I started doing this locally, so I wouldn’t lose any of my configurations (and have to start from scratch any time I wanted to change something). But now with `git`, I can track changes, revert if necessary, and of course share with the community through GitHub.

Anyway, it’s just configurations for now, the kinds of thing you can configure with [QMK](https://qmk.fm), [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com), or a web configurator (depending on the board), but I’d love to add pictures and maybe a keycap catalog alongside.

Who knows, maybe I’ll even turn this into a website? Stay tuned.
